Lined Terminal Background Images

ayo fam, so these are some images I generated for terminal lines. They work with Windows Terminal, and probably others. You should be using pixmaps, but my experience with them is bad - But pngs work well enough.

In Windows Terminal - Open Settings > Appearance

- Add as background image  
- Set 'Background image stretch mode' to None  
- Set 'Background image alignment' to Top-Left   
- Make sure your font is 12pt.  
- Mess with Opacity slider
